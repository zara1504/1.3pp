        <p>
            Hello, I am Zara Danziger. I am a first-year student at Deakin University studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology. This unit about responsive web apps has helped me learn and understand the importance of creating webpages using different formats, techniques and ideas to make them responsive for the users and a good experience overall. Instead of taking a normal portfolio approach, I have chosen to make a responsive website to show you my skills and achievements. Some Information about me :)

I have always had a passion for gaming and I would love to be able to use my knowledge and skills to help create new games and bring new elements and designs to the playing field.
